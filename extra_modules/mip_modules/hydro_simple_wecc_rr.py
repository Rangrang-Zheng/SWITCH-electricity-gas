"""
Defines a simple hydro electric model that ensures minimum and average
water dispatch levels that can vary by timepoint. Most people use this
as a starting point for working with hydro because it's simple, fairly
reasonable, and easy to work with. This supports dispatchable resevoir-
based hydro plants. This module is not needed to support run-of-river
plants; those may be specified as variable renewable plants with exogenous
energy availability.

A more full-featured hydro model is available from the Operations, Control
and Markets laboratory at Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile.
Where possible, I have used the same set and variable names to hopefully
make it easier to merge that into the codebase later. The Chilean branch
has a hydro model that includes water networks that connect dams via waterways
and ground infiltration. It should be possible to describe a simple system
using the advanced framework, but the advanced framework would take longer to
read and understand. To really take advantage of it, you'll also need more
data than we usually have available.

INPUT FILE INFORMATION

    The file hydro_timeseries.csv needs to contain
    entries for each dispatchable hydro project. The set of hydro projects
    is derived from this file, and this file should cover all time periods
    in which the hydro plant can operate.

    Run-of-River hydro projects should not be included in this file; RoR
    hydro is treated like any other variable renewable resource, and
    expects data in variable_capacity_factors.csv.

    hydro_timeseries.csv
        hydro_generation_project, hydro_timeseries, hydro_min_flow_mw,
        hydro_avg_flow_mw

    The file hydro_timepoints.csv is an optional mapping of timepoints
    to a hydro timeseries. Hydro timeseries are different from the SWITCH
    timeseries (timeseries.csv) as this allows hydro constraints to be
    specified over a different time period.

    HYDRO_GENS is the set of dispatchable hydro projects. This is a subet
    of GENERATION_PROJECTS, and is determined by the inputs file hydro_timeseries.csv.
    Members of this set can be called either g, or hydro_g.

    HYDRO_TS is the set of hydro timeseries over which the average flow constraint is defined.
    These hydro timeseries are different from the timeseries used in the reset of SWITCH
    and are defined by the input file hydro_timepoints.csv. If hydro_timepoints.csv doesn't exist,
    the default is for the timeseries to be the same as the SWITCH timeseries from timeseries.csv.
    Members of this set can be abbreviated as hts.

    HYDRO_GEN_TS is the set of Hydro projects and hydro timeseries for which
    minimum and average flow are specified. Members of this set can be
    abbreviated as (project, hydro_timeseries) or (g, hts).

    HYDRO_GEN_TPS is the set of Hydro projects and available
    dispatch points. This is a filtered version of GEN_TPS that
    only includes hydro projects.

    tp_to_hts[tp in TIMEPOINTS] is a parameter that returns the hydro timeseries
    for a given timepoint. It is defined in hydro_timepoints.csv and if unspecified
    it defaults to be equal to tp_ts.

    hydro_min_flow_mw[(g, hts) in HYDRO_GEN_TS] is a parameter that
    determines minimum flow levels, specified in units of MW dispatch.

    hydro_avg_flow_mw[(g, hts) in HYDRO_GEN_TS] is a parameter that
    determines average flow levels, specified in units of MW dispatch.

    Enforce_Hydro_Min_Flow[(g, t) in HYDRO_GEN_TPS] is a
    constraint that enforces minimum flow levels for each timepoint.

    Enforce_Hydro_Avg_Flow[(g, hts) in HYDRO_GEN_TS] is a constraint
    that enforces average flow levels across each hydro timeseries.
